# Factroundustry
**Factorio + Sound + Mindustry = Factroundustry**       
An Soundpack that changes all sounds and musics from Factorio. **the mod is in demo version.**

If you use it with Xeloboyo/Factoriodustry you can feel more factroio-like.

**Note that musics will not work on 7.0 cause its not an mp3 file.**
